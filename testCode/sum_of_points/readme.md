put the script for adding points on an elliptic curve in this directory.

the basic format I'm looking for should be something like this:



---------------------------

## comments about what the code is and who is writing it

## start with the curve given by the equation y^2 = x^3 + stuff
## take points P_1 = (1, 4) and P_2 = (whatever)

## compute their sum

some sage commands

set variables p1, p2 and q = p1 + p2
output (print) something like "the sum of the points .. and .. on the curve .. is ..."
