Welcome to the readme file!

This package will use the algorithms described in the paper "Relative Brauer groups of genus 1 curves," by Ciperiani and Krashen, in order to compute relative Brauer groups.

This is a translation/rewriting of a prior package in Macaulay 2/pari to the more sane world of Sage.
